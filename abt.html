        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h5>Rider & <span>Traveller</span></h5>
          <p>We love bikes. We love travelling. And, we want you to love them too! What started as a bike rental platform a year ago is now a complete ecosystem of bikes. From two wheeler rentals to riding gears, from exclusive bike merchandise to road trips and tours, from bike refurbishing and maintenance to fleet management system - we have them all.

Our team of ninjas aim to bridge the gap between bike fanatics and their need for a perfect go-to for all their biking needs. Whether you’re a student in a new city or someone who just joined work - you can rent a bike for a day, a week or even a couple of months, leave your bikes at the station for some good ol’ maintenance and pick up some exclusive merch too! Whether you’re a startup with a small sales team or a food delivery giant, a logistics company or a renowned restaurant - for everything that depends on two wheels - ‘ONN Bikes Hai Na’!

We also host a frequent travel series called Wander ONN where we take you on an epic bike journey at amazingly affordable prices. Check our Facebook page for upcoming getaways and more!</p>
